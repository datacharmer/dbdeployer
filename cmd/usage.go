	USING A SANDBOX

Change directory to the newly created one (default: $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_VERSION 
for single sandboxes)
[ $SANDBOX_HOME = $HOME/sandboxes unless modified with flag --sandbox-home ]

The sandbox directory of the instance you just created contains some handy 
scripts to manage your server easily and in isolation.

"./start", "./status", "./restart", and "./stop" do what their name suggests. 
start and restart accept parameters that are eventually passed to the server. 
e.g.:

  ./start --server-id=1001

  ./restart --event-scheduler=disabled

"./use" calls the command line client with the appropriate parameters,
Example:

    ./use -BN -e "select @@server_id"
    ./use -u root

"./clear" stops the server and removes everything from the data directory,
letting you ready to start from scratch. (Warning! It's irreversible!)

"./send_kill" does almost the same as "./stop", as it sends a SIGTERM (-15) kill
to shut down the server. Additionally, when the regular kill fails, it will
send an unfriendly SIGKILL (-9) to the unresponsive server.

"./add_option" will add one or more options to my.sandbox.cnf, and restarts the
server to apply the changes.

"init_db" and "load_grants" are used during the server initialization, and should not be used
in normal operations. They are nonetheless useful to see which operations were performed
to set up the server.

"./show_binlog" and "./show_relaylog" will show the latest binary log or relay-log.

"./my" is a prefix script to invoke any command named "my*" from the 
MySQL /bin directory. It is important to use it rather than the 
corresponding globally installed tool, because this guarantees 
that you will be using the tool for the version you have deployed.
Examples:

    ./my sqldump db_name
    ./my sqlbinlog somefile

"./mysqlsh" invokes the mysql shell. Unlike other commands, this one only works
if mysqlsh was installed, with preference to the binaries found in "basedir".
This script is created only if the X plugin was enabled (5.7.12+ with --enable-mysqlx
or 8.0.11+ without --disable-mysqlx)

"./use_admin" is created when the sandbox is deployed with --enable-admin-address (8.0.14+)
and allows using the database as administrator, with a dedicated port.
`
	const multipleUsage string = ` USING MULTIPLE SERVER SANDBOX
On a replication sandbox, you have the same commands (run "dbdeployer usage single"), 
with an "_all" suffix, meaning that you propagate the command to all the members. 
Then you have "./m" as a shortcut to use the master, "./s1" and "./s2" to access 
the slaves (and "s3", "s4" ... if you define more).

In group sandboxes without a master slave relationship (group replication and 
multiple sandboxes) the nodes can be accessed by ./n1, ./n2, ./n3, and so on.

start_all    [options] > starts all nodes
status_all             > get the status of all nodes
restart_all  [options] > restarts all nodes
stop_all               > stops all nodes
use_all         "SQL"  > runs a SQL statement in all nodes
use_all_masters "SQL"  > runs a SQL statement in all masters
use_all_slaves "SQL"   > runs a SQL statement in all slaves
clear_all              > stops all nodes and removes all data
m                      > invokes MySQL client in the master
s1, s2, n1, n2         > invokes MySQL client in slave 1, 2, node 1, 2

The scripts "check_slaves" or "check_nodes" give the status of replication in the sandbox.

When the sandbox is deployed with --enable-admin-address (8.0.14+) the following scripts
are also created:

ma                    > invokes the MySQL client in the master as admin
sa1, sa2, na1, na2    > invokes MySQL client as admin in slave 1, 2, node 1, 2
use_all_admin "SQL"   > runs a SQL statement in all nodes as admin
